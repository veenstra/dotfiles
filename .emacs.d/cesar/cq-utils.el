This is like the default function `shell', which see.  The buffer

If buffer exists but shell process is not running, make new shell.
Program used comes from variable explicit-shell-file-name,
 or (if that is nil) from the ESHELL environment variable,
 or else from SHELL if there is no ESHELL.
If a file ~/.emacs_SHELLNAME exists, it is given as initial input
 (Note that this may lose due to a timing error if the shell
  discards input when it starts up.)
The buffer is put in shell-mode, giving commands for sending input
and controlling the subjobs of the shell.  See shell-mode.
See also variable shell-prompt-pattern.

The shell file name (sans directories) is used to make a symbol name
such as `explicit-csh-arguments'.  If that symbol is a variable,
its value is used as a list of arguments when invoking the shell.
Otherwise, one argument `-i' is passed to the shell.

Note that many people's .cshrc files unconditionally clear the prompt.
If yours does, you will probably want to change it."
